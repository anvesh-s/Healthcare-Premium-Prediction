# Healthcare-Premium-Prediction
Healthcare Premium Prediction project using Machine Learning Regression

Overview
This project focuses on predicting healthcare premiums using machine learning. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation. Error analysis was performed to identify and address areas of improvement in the models.

Features
Data Cleaning: Addressed inconsistencies and handled missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to derive insights.
Model Training: Developed and optimized machine learning models (Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso).
Error Analysis: Identified trends in mispredictions and refined the models accordingly.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Evaluation Metrics: R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/anvesh-s/Healthcare-Premium-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebooks.
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebooks step by step to reproduce the analysis and results.
Results
Models effectively predicted healthcare premiums, with optimized parameters achieving robust performance.
Error analysis highlighted specific demographic trends (e.g., age groups) for further investigation.
